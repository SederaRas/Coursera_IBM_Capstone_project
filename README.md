## Project Overview
This project focuses on finding the optimal location for a stakeholder interested in opening a Zumba Fitness Club in New York City, United States.

## Objectives
- **Avoid Saturation**: Identify neighborhoods that are not already crowded with fitness clubs or sports centers, with a particular emphasis on areas without an existing Zumba Fitness Club.
- **Demographic Targeting**: Prioritize neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic residents, provided the first condition is satisfied.
- **Socio-Economic Considerations**: Focus on areas where the unemployment rate is acceptable, the average income is medium to high, and the average rent is reasonable.

## Methodology 
Data science techniques such as *Clustering** will be applied to analyze and generate a list of the most promising neighborhoods based on the above criteria. Each area's advantages will be clearly outlined to assist in selecting the best possible location for the Zumba Fitness Club.

## Outcome
The analysis will yield a set of potential neighborhoods, each meeting the specified criteria, enabling an informed decision on the final location.
